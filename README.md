## How It Works
- The extension uses a simple model: it estimates your device's power usage while browsing and multiplies it by a global average carbon intensity to estimate grams of COâ‚‚ per second.
- The total is updated every second and saved in your browser.
- Click **Reset** to start over at any time.

## Customization
- **UI**: Easily update colors, fonts, or layout in `popup.css` and `popup.html`.
- **Icon**: Replace `icon128.png` with your own SVG/PNG for a custom look.
- **Estimation model**: Adjust the constants in `popup.js` for your device or region.
